# AI Dncryption Project

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to use AI to decrypt Ciphertexts encrypted by a group of different Ciphers, without knowing which Cipher was used on the initial text. The product is a Django web application built on the library "Ciphey", where the user can input their desired encrypted text, and get the decrypted text back. This project can be helpful for those who are interested in ARGs to decode ciphers easier.
